This was supposed to be a new tire. \\\\nI took the tire over to Flynn\\'s and they told me that someone punctured my tire, then tried to patch it. So there are resentful tire slashers? I find that very unlikely. After arguing with the guy and telling him that his logic was far fetched he said he\\'d give me a new tire \\\\\"this time\\\\\". \\\\nI will never go back to Flynn\\'s b/c of the way this guy treated me and the simple fact that they gave me a used tire!'\n",

Their motto is \\\"Overkill never fails.\\\"  All of their products cost a bit more than flimsy Chinese imports.

Fashionable with casual wear, it is also TSA  friendly with no metal parts.  \\n\\nCCW friendly shirts, rifle slings, utility bags, pouches and backpacks are also manufactured.  \\n\\nGreat products with patient and helpful store staff.</td>\n",

My wife and I were heading to a movie at the Harkins theatre next door and wanted a bite to eat before the flick started - so we popped into one of the nearest restaurants Ono Hawaiian BBQ (we talked about Rubio's but decided to try something new).  Believe me when I tell you it is not very often that I can not eat the food I have in front of me at dinner time - but this was one of those times (more on that below).\\n\\nThe service at this place was not particularly helpful, but we finally were able to place our order after their employee got off the phone.  Several items were out on their menu and two other items had black magic marker on their sign indicating they were permanently out (I understand changing menus, but this did not look particularly professional).\\n\\nOnce we ordered, we choose to sit at one of their high top tables or at least tried to.  The first one we sat at was dirty so we moved to the second one but then realized that was dirty too (this is in a restaurant with only one table occupied  - should not have have been too busy to keep the place clean.  Ditto for the third and fourth high top we tried.  So we moved to some round tables on the other side of the restaurant - two of the three were dirty there too and the third was in direct sunshine (can't blame the restaurant for the sun).  We did finally find a table with no crumbs, sauce smears or food left on it and sat down.  As we were eating one of the employees came out and cleaned one table, got a phone call and never came out for any of the others.\\n\\nI ordered the seafood noodle soup and my wife ordered some spare ribs.  The seafood was not fresh, smelled unpleasant and two of the shrimp in it had not be deveined (not appetizing and I was unable to eat given the smell and the appearance).  The same was true of my wife's food - it smelled bad, tasted bad and did not look good.  We would have talked to the manager but at this point no one was around (they were all in the back in the kitchen) and it was not clear any of the people there were management level anyway.  As I said above, it is pretty rare that I can not even choke down a meal - but we tossed it in the garbage and left (ended up having a bag of popcorn at the movies for dinner).\\n\\nJust because I am on a roll I will also mention that their shaved ice counter was not open - no big deal but it would have been nice if they had not left brooms and mops as well as boxes sitting out in their restaurant.\\n\\nAll -in-all, bad food, inattentive service, unpleasant smells and a dirty unprofessional looking restaurant combined for a wasted $18 of food.  Perhaps we just hit a really bad night for the restaurant, but I know I will not be back. \\nI</td>\n",

The place was not that busy, but we were a party of four with a child and they wanted to put us in a booth with no highchair. Not that big of a deal but we saw several larger tables that they said were spoken for larger parties. We were there for over 2 hrs and no one ever sat at the larger tables. It wasn't that big of a deal but they said that they only had a couple of high chairs in the entire restaurant and that both were unaccounted for at the moment. We later found out that someone had taken one of the highchairs outside and it was on the balcony. Our waited Bryan, excellent!! He comes from a family of 6 mostly female so he knew when he saw my husband and myself and 2 girls exactly how to treat the girls. Great guy very personable. On to the food. We spent right at 170.00 on the three of us that were eating. The baby (3yrs. old didn't really eat much....rice) we ordered from the sushi menu and had 4 rolls, Cherry Blossom, Rock and Roll, Jewelry Box, (2) Dragon Egg, Ballantyne Roll, Lime Rickey Shrimp, Rice and Chicken Bowl, another coconut shrimp with a honey sauce ?? and another roll. The food tasted good, but the aftermath was horrible. We all got sick. Today, Saturday morning at 8:15 am I am still sick with a stomach ache and upset stomach from some type of food poisoning or bad sushi. My whole family with the exception of our small child got sick. I have not felt this bad after eating sushi ever. We LOVE sushi and eat it on a regular basis. We had not been to Jade lately, but she specifically asked for Jade for her birthday. NOW, here comes the BEST part!!! WE have NEVER EVER called and spoke with anyone about a negative experience we have encountered! My husband called and spoke Shaun (the Manager) and he said he would have to call back. He spoke with his chef and called back and said the only thing we could possibly have gotten sick from was the soft shell crab. NOW, IF YOU TELL ME THERE IS A POSSIBILITY THAT I GOT SICK  AT YOUR RESTAURANT and then you offer the price of that entree which was $12.95 and another $7.00 for good measure. ARE YOU INSANE!!!!!!! We spent $170.00. VERY BIG MISTAKE!!!     \\n\\nMy father and grandparents had owned restaurants for 50 yrs. My sister and brother-in-law now have taken over one of the restaurants, my other brother owns another restaurant, I come from a family of restauranteurs. I know what good service is and I know how hard people in the restaurant industry work. I worked in the restaurant business in college and now my daughter works in the restaurant business for spending money through college. I come from this industry in my blood, I know how to treat people and how to make them happy and feel self worth. Did I also mention that almost all of the workers that started with my family continued to work there until retirement.  This alone speaks volumes about how you treat people!! ESPECIALLY OUR CUSTOMERS. \\n\\nYou treat them with kindness and respect, something Shaun does not know anything about in this day and age of trendy places with BAD FOOD!!!!!!!!!!!! MY ADVICE STAY AWAY FROM JADE RESTAURANT!! I wish I would have come on here and read the reviews about the poor sanitation of the restaurant before we came here. However, I have never really read food blogs or critiques on restaurants. This was worthy though of my pen and ink!</td>\n",
